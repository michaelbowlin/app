## Documentation

This framwork's documentation, included in this repo in the root directory, is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

### Running documentation locally

1. If necessary, [install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation) (requires v2.1.x).
  - **Windows users:** Read [this unofficial guide](https://github.com/juthilo/run-jekyll-on-windows/) to get Jekyll up and running without problems. We use Pygments for syntax highlighting, so make sure to read the sections on installing Python and Pygments.
2. From the root `/app` directory, run `jekyll serve` in the command line.
3. Open <http://localhost:9001> in your browser.

Learn more about using Jekyll by reading its [documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).
